# Misc_Projects

This is a repository of all projects that were decided do not need their own repo to exist in. Each directory is a different project/product for viewing access online.

(Not included: 
- super small HTML projects/snippets as part of a class for learning HTML
- completed textbook lessons of HTML, CSS, and JS because they cannot easily display which parts I completed as part of the coding lesson
)
